spdxheader
==========

This repo tracks spdxheader source code. It's a vscode extension, for generating
SPDX header in source file.

Install from source
===================

On Linux and macOS, in spdxheader repo, run:

	# Clone vscdevp.git into ../vscdevp.
	# Use HTTPS URL if you haven't set up SSH for GitHub.
	(cd ..; git clone git@github.com:barroit/vscdevp.git)

	# Install build tools
	pnpm -g add terser esbuild @vscode/vsce

	# Build and install extension
	resize=1 make

This requires esbuild, terser, vsce, jq, and m4 available in PATH. It builds the
resized version of extension and uses pnpm by default. You can tell it to use
another package manager by specifying npm=xxx in env. Just make sure it accepts
args like:

	i -D xxx

On Windows, workflow is the same. If you are not using POSIX compliant shell,
adjust the command syntax. Keep in mind tools like gmake, jq and m4 must be
available in PATH.

Why does this exist?
====================

Just because File Header Comment is dumb and hard to use like hell.
